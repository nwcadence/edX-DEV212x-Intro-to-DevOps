# The Value of DevOps #

Over the past 15 years, agile software development has gained immense popularity among software development teams. The agile process accelerates the software development process and forces a faster release cadence.

However, traditional IT operations teams struggle with this increased release cadence. The current operation practices made the release and operation processes reliable, but not agile. Additionally, the disconnects between development and operations increase mistakes and lead time when issues occur.

By embracing the DevOps culture and practices, all team members who are involved in creating, delivering, and monitoring software, can work together to ensure high quality releases at increasing frequencies.  

## Key values of DevOps ##
Here are the key values of DevOps. DevOps:

- Breaks walls of separation between teams and fosters better communication and collaboration throughout the application development lifecycle.
- Delivers software more frequently and produces higher quality software.
- Shortens lead time and software delivery cycles. (Lead time means the time required from code commit to code successfully running in production)

Puppet Labs published the State of DevOps Reports in the last five years based on responses from over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide. They concluded that organizations embracing DevOps practices consistently massively outperformed their peers. For example,  

- Companies with high-performing IT organizations are twice as likely to exceed their profitability, market share and productivity goals.
- High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead times.

# The History of DevOps #

The term "DevOps" was initiated relatively late.  At the Agile 2008 conference in Canada, Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois discussed "Agile Infrastructure". The term "DevOps" was promoted through a series of DevOpsDays starting in 2009 in Belgium. Since then, DevOpsDays conferences have been held in many countries worldwide.

# Overview of Labs #
# TODO #

The hands-on labs in this course aim to walk you through the creation of a DevOps/ Continuous Delivery pipeline, including infrastructure-as-code, configuration-as-code, as well as code deployment. We'll show you how to apply DevOps practices on deploying a fictitious ecommerce website called Parts Unlimited. The labs aren't required to successfully complete this course, but they are highly recommended as creating a pipeline really gives you a feel for the power of DevOps.

The Parts Unlimited website includes product listings by category, product details, shopping cart, order history, product recommendations, search, and more. The website is an open-source project, built on ASP.NET 5 MVC 6.  It was created based on the book, The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win, by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.

*Note: You don't need to understand the code in the application in order to follow the labs.*

The demos below intend to give you a quick overview of the Parts Unlimited application and the power of a DevOps pipeline.

***Note: Don't worry if you don't completely understand the concepts or process covered in the demos. Everything mentioned here will be explained in more details as we move forward in later modules.***

- How development and operations can work together and contribute to a unified DevOps process.


`Outline > Module 2: A Unified Process Between Dev and Ops > Agile, Source Control, and Automation in DevOps > How Agile Software Practices Apply to DevOps `

# How Agile Software Practices Apply to DevOps #

In this section, you'll learn how Agile software development has influenced DevOps. First, let's review the Agile manifesto and the principles behind the manifesto that apply directly to DevOps.

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development ###
"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

For more information, see <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" title="" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto.</a>

### 4 Principles behind the Agile Manifesto that apply to DevOps ###
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

`Outline > Module 2: A Unified Process Between Dev and Ops > Agile, Source Control, and Automation in DevOps > The Importance of Source Control in DevOps `

# The Importance of Source Control in DevOps #

### Source Control ###
Source Control is also called Version Control. It means the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Source Control:

- Is usually supported by a tool.
- Provides ways to see differences between versions.
- Allows parallel development through merges and branches.
- Is foundational in software development, but occasionally new to operations teams.

### Benefits of Source Control ###
According to the State of DevOps Report 2014, source control is one of the highest predictors of performance.

Gene Kim, one of the authors of The Phoenix Project, hypothesizes as to why:

- High numbers of failures are due to misconfiguration, instead of bad code. As a countermeasure, all production configuration should be checked into source control and used as a single source of truth.
- Source control allows anyone to recreate environments solely from what is in source control, as opposed to requiring individual or tribal knowledge.

### What needs to be source-controlled? ###
Basically, in a DevOps practice, everything needs to be source-controlled, including:

- Source Code
- Environment definition
- Infrastructure configuration
- Deployment scripts
- Documentation

`Outline > Module 2: A Unified Process Between Dev and Ops > Agile, Source Control, and Automation in DevOps > How Automation is Applied to DevOps `

# How Automation is Applied to DevOps #

### Key Benefits of Automation ###
Automation:

- Removes manual errors from common processes.
- Enables anyone to perform operations, such as building or deploying an application, since the entire process is encapsulated in the automation tool.
- Enables speed, reliability, and consistency.
- Empowers frequent releases and self-service.

There are many tools for automation in the Operations space, such as Puppet, Chef, PowerShell DSC, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and others. These tools enable automation for almost any task that is typically performed by operations staff, from provisioning and configuring machines to configuring networks and firewalls to monitoring (and correcting) configuration drift.

Throughout the following Dev-Test-Release pipeline, automation plays an important role to deliver value continuously.

`Outline > Module 2: A Unified Process Between Dev and Ops > Agile, Source Control, and Automation in DevOps > Delivering Small Increments of Value `

# Delivering Small Increments of Value #

### Small, frequent releases ###
Agile practices prefer small, frequent releases over large, infrequent releases. In the same way, scripts and configuration changes to infrastructure should be implemented and tested in small iterations rather than large chunks. Smaller releases have several advantages:

- Less risk since the change is small.
- Rapid feedback; if something isn't working, we know early on so that we can fix it more easily.
- Confidence in what is being built; each successful iteration builds confidence that the whole product will work.

For more information about how small frequent releases can reduce the error rate and deliver higher quality product, watch the demonstration below.

`Outline > Module 3: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Testing > Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Testing > Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery `

# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery #

### Continuous Integration ###
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared code line several times a day, and validating each integration with an automated build.

In practice, CI is often defined as having a build with unit tests that executes at every commit/ check-in to version control.

Continuous Integration (CI) provides many benefits, including: 

- Improving code quality based on rapid feedback
- Triggering for automated testing for every code change
- Better managing technical debt and conducting code analysis
- Reducing long, difficult and bug-inducing merges
- Increasing confidence in code long before production

### Continuous Delivery ###
Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time.

- It aims to build, test and release software faster and more frequently.
- It reduces the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to production.

In practice, continuous delivery focuses on automated deployment pipeline. This may have one or more manual approval gates prior to reaching production.

Continuous delivery provides many benefits, including:

- It encourages Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code;
- It enables automated testing throughout the pipeline.
- It provides visibility and fast feedback cycles.
- It makes going to production a low stress activity.

### Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment ###
Continuous Deployment is generally defined as a Continuous Delivery pipeline with no manual gates between initial code check-in and production.

Feature flags are commonly used in both patterns, however, they are often necessary for Continuous Deployment. Feature flags ensure that code deployed to a production environment is not necessarily released to all end users.

`Outline > Module 3: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Testing > Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Testing > Continuous Testing `

# Continuous Testing #

### Continuous Testing ###
Continuous testing is the execution of tests repeatedly against a code base and deployment environment.  
 
In practice, continuous testing is the most difficult part of continuous delivery pipeline to keep up to date.

Continuous testing provides quality gates throughout the pipeline and increases confidence in code long before production.

### Types of Testing ###

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Interface (UI) Testing
- Load and Performance Testing
- Manual and Exploratory Testing

# Defining a Build Pipeline #

### Build Pipeline ###
A build pipeline is an automated system responsible for Continuous Integration.

- It builds code, runs unit tests, creates packages, etc.
- It's generally triggered by a code check-in, or on a schedule.

### Defining a build pipeline ###
Typically, a build pipeline is defined with the following components: 

- *Trigger*

   Typically, when code is checked into a branch or folder in source control, a build is automatically triggered.

   Builds are typically failed if anything in the pipeline fails, alerting the team for potential issues. Mechanisms such as gated check-in prevent code from being merged into the source repo if the build fails, ensuring that the main branch is always clean.

- *Tasks*

   The code is compiled and other tasks, such as client side minification, are executed.  

- *Unit Testing*

   Unit tests are performed to validate that the code is of high quality. 

- *Code Analysis*

   Static code analysis is performed and other quality metrics are gathered into a Technical Debt Management system, such as SonarQube.  

- *Packaging and Versioning*

   Assemblies are versioned and packaged so that it is ready for deployment. Sometimes the packages are uploaded to a package repository.

# Configuration Management #

### Configuration Management ###

- Configuration Management means the management of configuration of all environments for an application.
	- Typically in the form of scripts that are version controlled.
- Configuration Management in the DevOps world is less formal than "traditional" configuration management.
	- It emphasizes encapsulation of configuration in code over formal documentation.
	- It means lighter weight, executable configurations that allow us to have configuration and environments as code.
		- **Infrastructure as Code:** Defining your environments, to include networks, servers, and other compute resources as a text file (script or definition) that is checked into version control and is used as the base source for creating or updating those environments. For instance, adding a new server should be done by editing a text file and running the release pipeline, not by remoting into the environment and spinning one up manually.
		- **Configuration as Code:** Defining the configuration of your servers, code and other resources as a text file (script or definition) that is checked into version control and is used as the base source for creating or updating those configurations. For instance, adding a new port to a firewall should be done by editing a text file and running the release pipeline, not by remoting into the environment and spinning one up manually.

### Benefits of Configuration Management ###

Configuration Management provides the following benefits:

- Allowing configuration to be version controlled
- Detecting and correcting configuration drift
- Treating infrastructure as flexible resource
- Facilitating automation
- Enabling automated scale-up and scale-out
- Providing environment consistency

`Outline > Module 4: Configuration Management, Release Management and Monitoring & Learning > Configuration Management and Release Management > Release Management `

# Release Management #

### Release Management ###

- Release management means managing what is deployed where, and how:
	- What: which versions of components.
	- Where: which environments are the applications deployed to.
	- How: automation and scripting to configure environments and deploy applications.
- Release management in the DevOps world is lighter weight and less formal than "traditional" release management.
	- It emphasizes on quick and consistent delivery over formal change control.

### Benefits of Release Management ###

Release Management provides the following benefits:

- Auditing and traceability of the releases
- Automation of the release process
- Visibility of what happened in the release
- Higher quality deliveries
- Confidence through successful and consistent deliveries

# Defining a Deployment Pipeline #

### Deployment Pipeline ###

A deployment pipeline is an automated system responsible for continuous delivery.  

- It deploys code to environments, enforces approval gates, and executes automated tests.
- It is generally triggered by manually or by a new build.

### Defining a Deployment Pipeline ###

Typically, a deployment pipeline is defined with the following components:

- Source package
- Trigger
- Environments
- Deployment scripts and tasks
- Automated testing
- Approval gates

# TODO - Based on decision with Module 5 - move this to Mod 5 #

# Application Performance Monitoring #

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM) ###

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) means monitoring and learning from "live site". 
- APM tools usually provide the following information:
	- Diagnostics and error reporting
	- Usage patterns and trends
	- Notifications on application performance
- Rules for application performance:
	- Keeping the site up and highly available at all times.
	- Automating scale up/down or out/in in order to save infrastructure costs and the costs of running the application.

### Major Benefits of Application monitoring ###

Application monitoring:

- Identifies problems in the application.
- Dives insights into backlog from production.
- Enables hypothesis driven development.
	- User telemetry helps the team to take proactive actions instead of reactive actions.

### Types of Application Monitoring ###

- Usage monitoring
- Availability monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Custom telemetry
