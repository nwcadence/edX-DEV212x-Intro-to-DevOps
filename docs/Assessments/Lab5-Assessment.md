>>Which statement below most accurately describes Application Performance Monitoring (APM)?

( ) Dynamically scale servers to ensure there is enough RAM, CPU and disk space.    
( ) Performing load tests on an application.    
(x) Monitoring usage and performance metrics in production.   
( ) Measuring the time taken between code check-in and deployment. 

[explanation]   
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is used, among other things, to monitor usage and performance metrics of an application in production.

Often, based on APM metrics a team will configure tools to autoscale servers (including RAM, CPU and disk space), however this is not a core part of APM. Instead, it is in response to APM measurements. Additionally, although performing load tests while measuring responses with an APM tool is often done, it is not the core purpose of APM. Finally, the time between code check-in and deployment is an excellent measure, however it is not related to APM.
