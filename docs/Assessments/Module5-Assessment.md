# Assessments #

Answer the questions in this section to test your knowledge of the topics covered in this module.

You have a maximum of **two** attempts to answer each question correctly. After you submit your second answer, you will be unable to change it.

Your scores from the module assessments will be combined, and account for 55% of your overall grade for the course.

>>Which statement below most accurately describes Application Performance Monitoring (APM)?

( ) Dynamically scale servers to ensure there is enough RAM, CPU and disk space.    
( ) Performing load tests on an application.    
(x) Monitoring usage and performance metrics in production.   
( ) Measuring the time taken between code check-in and deployment. 

[explanation]   
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is used, among other things, to monitor usage and performance metrics of an application in production.

Often, based on APM metrics a team will configure tools to autoscale servers (including RAM, CPU and disk space), however this is not a core part of APM. Instead, it is in response to APM measurements. Additionally, although performing load tests while measuring responses with an APM tool is often done, it is not the core purpose of APM. Finally, the time between code check-in and deployment is an excellent measure, however it is not related to APM.

<<display_name:Question 3; max_attempts:2; weight:10; rerandomize:always; showanswer:finished; show_reset_button:false>>

>>What are some types of Application Performance Monitoring? Select three answers.

[ ] Active Directory monitoring   
[x] Usage monitoring   
[x] Availability monitoring  
[x] Performance monitoring   

[explanation]   
Usage monitoring, availability monitoring, and performance monitoring are all types of Application Performance Monitoring. These can all be integrated together using application monitoring tools like App Insights.

>>What are some metrics that you can gather from Application Performance Monitoring? Select all that apply.

[x] User satisfaction   
[x] Average response time
[x] Failed request rate 
[x] Request rate

[explanation]   
User satisfaction (formula combining various metrics to determine how satisfied a user will be upon going to your site), average response time, failed request rate, and request rate are all examples of metrics you can use with Application Performance Monitoring.
