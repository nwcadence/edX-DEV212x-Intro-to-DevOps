## Exercise 1: ##

The goal of this first exercise is to help you reflect on your real-world software development and delivery process and identify areas that you can improve by adopting key DevOps practices. Don't worry about missing anything here. Your thoughts and understanding will evolve and improve as the course progresses and when you learn more about DevOps.

Completing all the exercises in the course account for 20% of your overall grade for the course. After completing the exercise, you need to mark completion in the self-check section on the bottom of the page.

#### Assignment Part One  ####
- Take the <a href="http://devopsassessment.azurewebsites.net/" title="" target="_blank">DevOps self-evaluation</a> from Microsoft. After completing this evaluation, you will be provided with specific feedback that helps you better understand your current practices and where to focus next.

       Or:

- If the DevOps self-evaluation doesn't apply to you or you prefer not to take it, you can just review what you've learned in this module and consider areas that you can improve upon in your current software delivery process.

#### Assignment Part Two ####
Based on the results from assignment part one,  write a summary about the areas you need to improve in your current software delivery process and how you can incorporate key DevOps practices to deliver higher quality software at a faster cadence. Share your summary in the discussion forum. Please try to limit your write-up to fewer than 750 words.

Assignment Part Three
Review the summaries submitted by two of your course-mates and provide your feedback. Please be specific and give examples.
