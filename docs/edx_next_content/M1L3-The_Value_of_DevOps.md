# The Value of DevOps #

Over the past 15 years, agile software development has gained immense popularity among software development teams. The agile process accelerates the software development process and forces a faster release cadence.

However, traditional IT operations teams struggle with this increased release cadence. The current operation practices made the release and operation processes reliable, but not agile. Additionally, the disconnects between development and operations increase mistakes and lead time when issues occur.

By embracing the DevOps culture and practices, all team members who are involved in creating, delivering, and monitoring software, can work together to ensure high quality releases at increasing frequencies.  

## Key values of DevOps ##
Here are the key values of DevOps. DevOps:

- Breaks walls of separation between teams and fosters better communication and collaboration throughout the application development lifecycle.
- Delivers software more frequently and produces higher quality software.
- Shortens lead time and software delivery cycles. (Lead time means the time required from code commit to code successfully running in production)

Puppet Labs published the State of DevOps Reports in the last five years based on responses from over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide. They concluded that organizations embracing DevOps practices consistently massively outperformed their peers. For example,  

- Companies with high-performing IT organizations are twice as likely to exceed their profitability, market share and productivity goals.
- High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead times.
