### Application Performance Monitoring (APM) ###

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) means monitoring and learning from a "live site". 
- APM tools usually provide the following information:
	- Diagnostics and error reporting
	- Usage patterns and trends
	- Notifications on application performance
- Rules for application performance:
	- Keeping the site up and highly available at all times.
	- Automating scale up/down or out/in in order to save infrastructure costs and the costs of running the application.
