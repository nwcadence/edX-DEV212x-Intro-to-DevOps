### Continuous Testing ###
Continuous testing is the execution of tests repeatedly against a code base and deployment environment.  
 
In practice, continuous testing is the most difficult part of continuous delivery pipeline to keep up to date.

Continuous testing provides quality gates throughout the pipeline and increases confidence in code long before production.

### Types of Testing ###

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Interface (UI) Testing
- Load and Performance Testing
- Manual and Exploratory Testing
