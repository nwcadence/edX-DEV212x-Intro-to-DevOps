# Getting Around the Course #

If you're new to edX, here is some information to help you get started. Even if you've used edX for other courses, the information here will help orient you on the layout of the course.

## Layout of the course ##
This course is laid out in modules and units. Each module contains 1 or more units that cover the material for that module. The module is the topic area and the units has all the learning material you'll need to learn that topic. To navigate through the module's units, use the navigation bar at the top of the module. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit will generally have some **video content**, **reading material and problem sets**, and a set of **assessment questions** to test your knowledge. Some units also have a **discussion board** where you can post questions and other material so fellow students can provide feedback. The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the assessments, you should learn the material in all the units. **Hover over the unit with your mouse to see the unit title.**

## Instructor feedback ##
Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, its not possible for instructors to provide feedback to students. However, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the discussion boards. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.

## Other Resources ##
<a href="https://www.edx.org/about/student-faq" title="" target="_blank">edX Student FAQ</a>: This FAQ answers a lot of questions about the edX student experience. You should at least read over the questions so if you encounter any issues during the course, you can refer back to this document for help.
