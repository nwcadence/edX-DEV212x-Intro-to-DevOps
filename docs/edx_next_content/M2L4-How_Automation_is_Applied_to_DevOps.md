# How Automation is Applied to DevOps #

### Key Benefits of Automation ###
Automation:

- Removes manual errors from common processes.
- Enables anyone to perform operations, such as building or deploying an application, since the entire process is encapsulated in the automation tool.
- Enables speed, reliability, and consistency.
- Empowers frequent releases and self-service.

There are many tools for automation in the Operations space, such as Puppet, Chef, PowerShell DSC, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and others. These tools enable automation for almost any task that is typically performed by operations staff, from provisioning and configuring machines to configuring networks and firewalls to monitoring (and correcting) configuration drift.

Throughout the following Dev-Test-Release pipeline, automation plays an important role to deliver value continuously.
