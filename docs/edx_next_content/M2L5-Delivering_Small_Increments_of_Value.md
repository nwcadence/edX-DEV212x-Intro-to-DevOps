# Delivering Small Increments of Value #

### Small, frequent releases ###
Agile practices prefer small, frequent releases over large, infrequent releases. In the same way, scripts and configuration changes to infrastructure should be implemented and tested in small iterations rather than large chunks. Smaller releases have several advantages:

- Less risk since the change is small.
- Rapid feedback; if something isn't working, we know early on so that we can fix it more easily.
- Confidence in what is being built; each successful iteration builds confidence that the whole product will work.

For more information about how small frequent releases can reduce the error rate and deliver higher quality product, watch the demonstration below.
