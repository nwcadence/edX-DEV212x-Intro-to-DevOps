# Release Management #

### Release Management ###

- Release management means managing what is deployed where, and how:
	- What: which versions of components.
	- Where: which environments are theÂ applications deployed to.
	- How: automation and scripting to configure environments and deploy applications.
- Release management in the DevOps world is lighter weight and less formal than "traditional" release management.
	- It emphasizes on quick and consistent delivery over formal change control.

### Benefits of Release Management ###

- Auditing and traceability of the releases
- Automation of the release process
