### Feedback ###

One of the primary motivations for DevOps is to receive fast feedback, and it's important for us to begin this module by explaining why you should care about getting feedback. 

Take a moment to answer this question for yourself: How do you currently know that you're building the right features for your apps? Do you have any way of knowing now that the features are being used as they were intended and are producing the expected amount of value in return? 

Without detailed feedback being returned for your app, you may rely on guessing or assumptions that may be incorrect for which new features to build or which features are relevant. This costs time and money for putting in effort to build features that may have an unknown return on investment (ROI).

Using practices in DevOps, we can ensure that we are building the features that are most relevant and valuable by receiving fast feedback the new features. One practice in DevOps for this is using hypothesis-driven development, which is the idea of creating a hypothesis, testing it with an experiment, and measuring that hypothesis. In other words, starting off development on a feature with a hypothesis or expectation that when the feature is released, it will drive *N* number of additional users within 24 hours. Another addition to hypothesis-driven development can be adding the business problem that this feature will solve (the "why") so it can be understood that this feature is specifically addressing a business problem. 

Now how do we obtain feedback on our app? This module will address different ways that feedback can be gathered through different tools and practices, including through A/B Testing, Feature Flags, and monitoring tools (such as Application Performance Management).
