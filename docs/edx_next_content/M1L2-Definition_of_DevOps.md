# Definition of DevOps #

> DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.
> 
> You cannot buy DevOps and install it. DevOps is not just automation or infrastructure as code. DevOps is people following a process enabled by products to deliver value to end users.
> 
> -- Donovan Brown, Microsoft DevOps Program Manager
