# How Agile Software Practices Apply to DevOps #

In this section, you'll learn how Agile software development has influenced DevOps.Â First, let's review the Agile manifesto and the principles behind the manifesto that apply directly to DevOps.

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development ###
"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

### 4 Principles behind the Agile Manifesto that apply to DevOps ###
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
