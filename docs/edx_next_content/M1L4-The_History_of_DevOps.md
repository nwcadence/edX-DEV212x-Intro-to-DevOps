# The History of DevOps #

The term "DevOps" was initiated relatively late.  At the Agile 2008 conference in Canada, Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois discussed "Agile Infrastructure". The term "DevOps" was promoted through a series of DevOpsDays starting in 2009 in Belgium. Since then, DevOpsDays conferences have been held in many countries worldwide.
