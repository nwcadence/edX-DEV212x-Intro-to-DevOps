# The Importance of Source Control in DevOps #

### Source Control ###
Source Control is also called Version Control. It means the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Source Control:

- Is usually supported by a tool.
- Provides ways to see differences between versions.
- Allows parallel development through merges and branches.
- Is foundational in software development, but occasionally new to operations teams.

### Benefits of Source Control ###
According to the State of DevOps Report 2014, source control is one of the highest predictors of performance.

Gene Kim, one of the authors of The Phoenix Project, hypothesizes as to why:

- High numbers of failures are due to misconfiguration, instead of bad code. As a countermeasure, all production configuration should be checked into source control and used as a single source of truth.
- Source control allows anyone to recreate environments solely from what is in source control, as opposed to requiring individual or tribal knowledge.

### What needs to be source-controlled? ###
Basically, in a DevOps practice, everything needs to be source-controlled, including:

- Source Code
- Environment definition
- Infrastructure configuration
- Deployment scripts
- Documentation
