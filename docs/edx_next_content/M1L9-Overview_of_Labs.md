# Overview of Labs #
# TODO #

The hands-on labs in this course aim to walk you through the creation of a DevOps/ Continuous Delivery pipeline, including infrastructure-as-code, configuration-as-code, as well as code deployment. We'll show you how to apply DevOps practices on deploying a fictitious ecommerce website called Parts Unlimited. The labs aren't required to successfully complete this course, but they are highly recommended as creating a pipeline really gives you a feel for the power of DevOps.

The Parts Unlimited website includes product listings by category, product details, shopping cart, order history, product recommendations, search, and more. The website is an open-source project, built on ASP.NET 5 MVC 6.  It was created based on the book, The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win, by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.

*Note: You don't need to understand the code in the application in order to follow the labs.*

The demos below intend to give you a quick overview of the Parts Unlimited application and the power of a DevOps pipeline.

***Note: Don't worry if you don't completely understand the concepts or process covered in the demos. Everything mentioned here will be explained in more details as we move forward in later modules.***
