# Welcome #

Welcome to the course **Introduction to DevOps!** My name is Lei Ma. I work as a Content Developer at Microsoft and will be your host for this course. While designing and authoring this course,  I had the privilege to work with a lot of DevOps experts at Microsoft and industry expert Steven Borg, who helped make this course happen.

We're very excited to have you join us and we hope that you have an enriching and engaging learning experience.

Before you get started with the course material, please read through the brief overview pages in this unit so you can become oriented to the course structure, the schedule, and how things will work in this course. As always, we welcome your feedback so if something is confusing or doesn't work the way you expect, let us know and we'll do our best to address it. 

***Please take a moment to introduce yourself in the discussion forum in this module.  This will help fellow learners to know a little bit more about you and helps make later discussions a little bit easier.***
