# Homework Assignment

Write a summary or draw a diagram on your own of what the process looks like from starting to work on code to deploying and monitoring in production as it is now for your organization. Take note of how features are decided to be worked on, what the process is for making changes to code, how code is compiled and tested, how it is deployed to different environments, and how it is monitored for usage and performance. 


*Note: This does not need to be submitted, but is an important process for you to better understand where your organization is at and where it can improve in the future.*
