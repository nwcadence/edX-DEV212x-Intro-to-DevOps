## The LABs ##
Please review the course material and videos before returning to this repository to do the LABs.  The labs are made up of two tracks, supporting both a Linux environment running a Java application, or a Windows environment running a .NET application.  Since Azure fully supports both models, both have similar structures and deploymnent processes (although different tools are used). Feel free to select the model that is closest to your experience, or choose both! The labs parallel each other, showing the flexibility in toolsets.
